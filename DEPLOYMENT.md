## 🌐 Netlify Frontend Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify
1. Login to [Netlify](https://netlify.app)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
3. Upload the entire `dist/` folder
4. Your site will be deployed instantly

### Step 2: Configure Netlify Settings

2. Set Build command: `echo 'Frontend already built'`
3. Set Publish directory: `.` (current directory)

### Step 3: Configure Redirects
The `_redirects` file is already configured to:
- Redirect `/api/*` to your Railway backend
- Handle SPA routing for React-style navigation

### MongoDB Atlas (Recommended):
1. Create account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster
3. Get connection string
4. Update `MONGODB_URI` in environment variables

### Local MongoDB:
- For development, you can use: `mongodb://localhost:27017/agroculture`
